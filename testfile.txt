Yay!
testing github repos.

In the some_taginfo branch. Branched of the edit_v1 tag.

Testing commit this and push.
Check if branch edit_branch is pushed too?
Right now local is 1 ahead.

To push a new local branch to origin (without the branch) use command: 
git push --set-upstream origin some_taginfo

Result: The (edit_branch) did not push to origin.

Yay!
testing github repos.

In the some_taginfo branch. Branched of the edit_v1 tag.

Testing commit this and push.
Check if branch edit_branch is pushed too?
Right now local is 1 ahead.

To push a new local branch to origin (without the branch) use command: 
git push --set-upstream origin some_taginfo

Result: The (edit_branch) did not push to origin.

Initial, just playing around.

This is 1stbranch! ###Not anymore, merged and deleted to master###
Did a rebase of 1stbranch from master.
Then pull.
-Strange things happened to the git tree view.

Just did a signed Tag in branch "edit_branch" on commit 1936b65
This is master. (protected?)
$ git tag -s -m "Tag along" edit_v1 1936b65



Who can see this?
Who can commit?

Merged 1stbranch to master and deleted the branch.
Do we got history?
This is still a working branch. Some suff is missing from master.x
Efter den här incheckningen så tänker jag tagga #1936b65

Where is my Tag showing?
Local git log but not in GitHub
Must explicitly push tags to origin

$git tag                     #lists the tag. lightweight?
$git tag -v edit_v1          #checks the tag. Verifies GPG sign.
$git push origin [tagname]   #Pushes tag to origin

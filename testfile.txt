Yay!
testing github repos.

Initial, just playing around.

This is 1stbranch! ###Not anymore, merged and deleted to master###
Did a rebase of 1stbranch from master.
Then pull.
-Strange things happened to the git tree view.

Just did a signed Tag in branch "edit_branch" on commit 1936b65
This is master. (protected?)
$ git tag -s -m "Tag along" edit_v1 1936b65
